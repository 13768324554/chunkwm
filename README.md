## Configuration

**chunkwm** itself has a very sparse configuration file, located at `$HOME/.chunkwmrc`.

A symlink can be made for people who wish to keep the actual file in some other location.

The config file is simply a bash script that specifies which plugins to load and how they are loaded.

See [example config](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm/blob/master/examples/chunkwmrc)
